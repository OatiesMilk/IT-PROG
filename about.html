    <h2>Who are we?</h2>
    <p>
        Greetings and good tidings to those who wish to avail the services of our liege Lord Farquad,
        who has graciously allowed us to use his Arena and Castle to host grand events.
    </p>
    <p>
        As such, we the "Shrekers" have made this site and named it after our liege lord Farquad to make it
        easier to book tickets. We understand the thrill and anticipation that accompany live events,
        whether it's cheering for your favorite knights in a jousting tournament, enjoying a captivating
        jester performance, or networking at a prestigious royal gathering.
